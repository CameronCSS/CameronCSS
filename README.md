## **About**
I began my career transition from retail to data analyst in December 2022.

Since then, Iâ€™ve gained hands-on experience in cleaning and analyzing data with SQL, Excel, and Python. I have also developed an expertise in crafting data visualizations using Power BI, Tableau, and Looker, which has built a strong foundation in data analysis and reporting.

My journey has also led me to discover a passion for coding with Python and JavaScript. I truly enjoy building web apps and writing custom code to elevate projects and solve both simple and complex problems. This has began my secondary tech journey coding custom solutions that take simple things and make them much more complicated than they need to be.

Outside of my professional work, youâ€™ll often find me exploring art, coding new apps, and spending quality time with my two kids.
