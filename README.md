## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Cameron, a dedicated Data Analyst from Utah with a passion for transforming complex data into business solutions.

<sub><em>ðŸ”¥ Cooking up Data and web tools since 2022.</em> </sub>

## **About**
As a Freelance Data Analyst, I specialize in building and managing advanced database systems, automating data preprocessing, and ensuring consistency across diverse platforms. My work has empowered clients with clean, actionable data, enhancing their decision-making processes. Iâ€™m also expanding my expertise into data science, where Iâ€™m building and deploying machine learning models to predict future trends and outcomes, moving beyond traditional data analysis.

I am certified by Harvard University (CS50), Microsoft, the University of Michigan, and LinkedIn Learning, with advanced knowledge in SQL, Power BI, and data analytics. 
My education has provided a solid foundation in computer science, databases, and sophisticated data processing, and Iâ€™m continually expanding my skills in machine learning and predictive modeling.

Beyond my professional work, I enjoy coding creative projects, exploring art, and spending quality time with my family. Whether visualizing HR performance metrics, analyzing review sentiment with NLP, or conducting retail price comparisons, I am dedicated to pushing the boundaries of data analysis to drive meaningful outcomes.
