## **About**

In 2022 I started studying data tools and really diving into analytics. I learned a lot about SQL databases and presenting data to non-technical peers.

During this time I also discovered a love for creating apps and useful tools. With my knowledge of databases and data structures it slowly led me towards backend software development. 
<br>
<br>
Fast forward to 2024, and here I am, deeply engrossed in Fullstack software development, with a keen focus on JavaScript and making useful Web apps.
