## About Me

As a data professional with a passion for visualization and storytelling, 
my goal is to utilize my skills in SQL, Power BI, Tableau, and Python to turn complex data sets into easily understandable insights.
With a background in project management and business analysis, I have the ability and drive to effectively communicate findings and collaborate with cross-functional teams. 

I am always seeking new opportunities to learn and grow as a data analyst, and am excited to be a part of a community of like-minded data nerds.
