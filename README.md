## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Cameron, a dedicated Data Analyst from Utah.

<sub><em>Building Business Solutions and web tools since 2022.</em> </sub>
<br>

## **About**
As a Freelance Data Analyst, I'm experienced in building and managing advanced database systems, automating data processing, and ensuring consistency across various client environments. 
My work has delivered clients with clean, actionable data, enhancing their decision-making processes.

Iâ€™m also expanding my expertise into data science, where Iâ€™m building and deploying machine learning models to predict future trends and outcomes, moving beyond traditional data analysis.

I am certified by Harvard University, Google, Microsoft, the University of Michigan, and LinkedIn Learning, with advanced knowledge in SQL, Power BI, and data analytics.

Outside of my professional work, I enjoy coding projects, creating art, and spending quality time with my kids. 

Letâ€™s connect to discuss how data-driven strategies can transform your business!
