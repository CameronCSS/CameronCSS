## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Cameron

I love Data!! You know what I really love?  WHY!!  Why were sales down this month. Why did we gain a bunch of customers yesterday?Why doesn't everyone use YYYY-MM-DD??
<br><sup>*(I hope you can feel my personality through the screen right now!)*</sup>

> [!NOTE] 
> I am currently diving deep into data engineering and python coding. BOTH!??  HOW!??  Well... I make a Snake game, and then I build a database around it to track high scores and see what times of day have the highest scores!  why not!?

### Skills and Knowledge:
- Python
- SQL
- Tableau
- Excel
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Web Scraping
- Ensuring clean, high-quality data
- Optimizing data pipelines (My first Snowflake bill vs every month after can be proof of this!)
