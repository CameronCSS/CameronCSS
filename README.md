## **About**
I began my career transition from retail to data analyst in December 2022. Since then, Iâ€™ve gained hands-on experience in cleaning and analyzing data with SQL, Excel, and Python. I have also developed an expertise in crafting data visualizations using Power BI, Tableau, and Looker, which has built a strong foundation in data analysis and reporting.

My journey has also led me to discover a passion for coding with Python and JavaScript. I truly enjoy building web apps and writing custom code to elevate projects and solve both simple and complex problems.

Outside of my professional work, youâ€™ll often find me exploring art, coding new apps, and spending quality time with my two kids.
