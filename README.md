## 👋 Hi there! I'm Cameron

Things about me:

- I love Data!! You know what I really love?  WHY!!  Why were sales down this month. Why did we gain a bunch of customers yesterday?Why doesn't everyone use YYYY-MM-DD??

<sub>*(I hope you can feel my personality through the screen right now!)*</sub>

- I am just so passionate about data, and tech, and Coding cool little tools that make everyday tasks easier.
- I consider myself a SQL guru, but I know there is ALWAYS more to learn. (Watch my [YouTube SQL series!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FmTwp4zRqg&list=PLsuBbPvs8LZU_Bm22kKaaCCCd7jUAwn9H))

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> I am currently diving deep into data engineering and python coding. BOTH!??  HOW!??  Well... I make a Snake game, and then I build a database around it to track high scores and see what times of day have the highest scores!  why not!?

### Skills and Knowledge:
- Python
- SQL I consider myself a SQL guru, but I know there is ALWAYS more to learn. (Watch my YouTube SQL series!)
- Tableau
- Excel
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Web Scraping

["Professional" sentence to talk about the Hard / technical skills]

My technical expertise includes certifications from Harvard, Google, Microsoft, the University of Michigan, and LinkedIn Learning, with advanced knowledge in Python, SQL, data modeling, and various data engineering tools and frameworks.

Outside of my professional work, I enjoy coding projects, creating art, and spending quality time with my kids.
